**Ok so this feature request is related to an update query of sqlite 3**
Currently i have used insert query and delete query from backend code together in update funtion of frontend code.

**The solution i am looking for**
The backend code should contain an update function with update sqlite 3 query.This function should update the student information from frontend into the ***database.***
The frontend code update function should ***pass variables(to be updated) as parameters to update function of backend*** and finally display the updated values.
